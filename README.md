# MRP-Softskill-Extraction

HR personnel go through a difficult process of selecting candidates for a particular job
description. In the past, candidate selection is done by using Boolean information retrieval (IR) methods
which are based on keyword search. A list of key terms related to the job description is crafted by HR
and the candidate’s resume is matched against these terms. In recent times, HR practice is moving
towards skill-based recruitment where candidates are ranked according to the number of skills, skill’s
competence level and skill’s experience. This requires accurate identification of different skills from
the candidate’s CV.
Current systems rely on a combination of dictionary/rule-based methods, ontologies and machine
learning (ML) classifiers. However, most of them do not scale well in real-world use cases. Previous
works were mainly restricted to hard or/and soft skills extraction. However, a more granular
classification for skill extraction is required in skill-based recruiting to make informed decisions about
the candidates.
The challenge is how to automatically identify and extract these skills from job descriptions and CVs.
The task is less complex for hard skills which in some cases could be named entities but much more
challenging for soft skills which may appear in different linguistic forms. The goal of this project work
is to develop context-aware machine learning systems to identify and classify different kinds of skills
from job descriptions and resumes.
